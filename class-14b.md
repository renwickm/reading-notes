## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

### Notes from the Reading

The discussion from the reading above, titled *What Google Learned from its Quest to Build the Perfect Team* centers around team and group dynamics.  
Some of the questions posed were:
1.What determines success in a group or team?
2.What are some fundamental attributes of a successful group? An unsuccessful group?
3.What was Sakaguchi's strategy as leader of his team of softerware engineers at Google?

There are many types of people with many different personalities. But aside from their differences, some of the qualities that promote success amongst a group or team setting have more to do with specific qualities. Some of these qualities are the ability to read emotions effectively paired with the control to adjust to the realization of emotions in others among the team. Another is understanding common social norms. Another one is opening yourself up to the group, promoting a safe space to talk personally about some of your deepest insecurities, a strategy that Sakaguchi tried with his team at Google.

Some of the more common attributes of a successfull group are unexpected. Many of these traits coud be considered common knowledge but, at the other end of it, easily forgotten in a competitive work environment. It can be hard for those who want to be heard and do so with force, often speaking over people, not letting other team members finish out a line of thought. this type of thinking can promote negative consequences among a group or team. Rozovsky identified her experience from working in a study group that was similar to this. Often, she found herself more anxious about going to these groups because of it. Another one of her groups she later joined was completely opposite. While it was a competitive based group, team dynamics focused on promoting talk among individuals and allowing for unsolicited individual interpretation. This meaning that group memebers didn't feel the anxious tension from speaking up freely, as the fear from being cut off or shut down was not apparent.

As described earlier, Sakaguchi was a leader of software developers at Google. He found himself in a great position, even felt like somehow he had won the lottery. His background before getting the leadership position was not what you'd think it would be, or needed to be. Many of the developers on his team had a lot more experience than him, but maybe not the leadership skills. While many of them were talented, Sakaguchi noticed some things weren't functioning well so he had his team fill out a questionnairre. To his surpise, the results showed that many of the team did not know what the importance of what they were doing was. Meaning, many of them didn't understand the goal, and thus didn't see the concept of a unified goal which is common among successful teams. They didn't value their work at a level that Sakaguchi would like to see. He decided to open up to them about some of his personal issues with the idea of promoting the same effect in the team, hoping this would bring the team closer together and open up the awareness of the same effect in others. In doing so, he found that the team become more open and the dynamics of the team were better served.
