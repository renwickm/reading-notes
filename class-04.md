# Code 201 Class 04 Reading Notes

## Why this is important

The reading for this section describe HTML elements such as links, CSS layouts such as block-level and inline, and JS function processes. It is important to understand how to encorporate links into your code because it will probably be something that is often used. Understanding how content is structured will also be important because in order to manipulate it you need to understand the order of which content lays on the page. JS seems to be the most complex, yet one of the more beneficial aspects of the webpage.

## Creating Hyperlinks in HTML

To create a basic link, we wrap text or other content inside an **anchor** element:

-<a>hyperlink goes here</a>

The *href* attribute contains the **url** from the the site you are look to pin to your anchor element.

To better allow for accessibility to all readers:

-Don't repeat the URL as part of the link text;
-Keep your link text as short as possible;
-Minimize instances where multiple copies of the same text are linked to different place; 

## CSS Layout: Normal Flow CSS Layout: Positioning

### Normal flow

Normal flow is like the default flow to a webpages element layout. Without making any changes to it, normal flow will apply the default layout settings of the webpage.

### Block level and Inline

Block level elements always start on a new line while inline elements do not; also, inline elements only take up as much width as necessary.  

***Static*** Positioning is the default that every HTML element.

Some advantages of using *absolute* position are:

1. Allows you to position page elements exactly where you want it.
2. You can apply fixed position rules to a block, than use absoulte position rules to adjust easily.

The key difference between **fixed** and **absolute** positioning is that the position and dimensions of an element with an absolut position are relative to its containg block, whereas a the position and demensions of an element with a fixed position are always relative to the initial containing block.

## Learn CSS

A ***function declaration*** refers to the part of the function sequence where the function is *defined*.

A ***function invocation*** refers to the operations of the function. In other words, invoking refers to 'running' the function.

A ***parameter*** refers to the values that need to be included inside the functioin parenthese; can also be called *arguments*, *properties*, or even *attributes*.

An ***argument*** is the actual value that are passed to variables defined in the method header when the method is called from another method. 

## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

Name two benefits:

1. Greater efficiency - pair programming would be benificial because it has shown to provide a quality end-product. This meaning that, while it may take longer to tackle projects serving one role on a project, declaring responsibility among team members lightens that workload and directs key members in serving their roles more effectively. In the long-run, it is more effective.

2. Engaged Collaboration - When working in pairs, programmers are forced into accountability of their work because it has an affect on the other member. In this case, it holds the other accountable and encourages collaboration because pairs rely on each other to complete projects.
