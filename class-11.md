## Readings: Audio, Video, Images

### Video and Audio Content

1.Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000's.

Video and Audio web capabilities have greatly evolved since the 2000's. It was difficult to apply these to any webpage due to the nature of their size in bandwidth and the speed at which applications were able to run at that time. Now, our technical abilities have improved.With many video enabled applications such as Flash and Silverlight leading the way. HTML was not capable of producing video and audio capabilities and had to rely on applications such as them. However, with the induction of HTML5 you now can run such applications on it. 

2.Describe the use of the `src` and `controls` attributes in the `<video>` element.

The `src` attribute is similar to the `src` attribut with images. They provide a source url/path to the referenced material you want to display.

The `controls` attribute allows you to apply either the browser own controls interface or custom build controls in your own way. Some points of emphasis in these controls apply to people with disabilities such as epilepsy that give them control over the video display settings. 

3.Why is it important to have **fallback content** inside the `<video>` element?

In case the user browser does not support video playback, users should be provided with older browser playback. This is called fallback content. It is a back-up to the initial plan.

4.Write a very short story where `<audio>` and `<video>` are characters.
