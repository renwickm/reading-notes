## CSS Transorms

1.What does a CSS transform allow the developer to do to an element?

With the installment of CSS3, the *transform* property in CSS works to position and alter elements in their layout structure.

2.Provide an example of a transform and how you could see that being used on a website.

The transform property repositions elements into 2D and/or 3D. One option within the transform property is to utilize the scale. This feature allows adjustment to the scale, or size of the element you are targeting. One thought to use this on websites would be to key in on images, or zoom in. The transform-origin property allows adjustments to specified sides of an element. For instance, visual of a cube and some of it's sides.

## CSS Transitions & Animations

1.What does a CSS transition allow the developer to do to an element?

The transition property allows you to change the appearance of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.

2.How does a CSS animation differ from a CSS transition?

With CSS transition, you are able to provide one change to an element, from one state to another. With CSS animation, you can apply multiple changes on an element, upon different keyframes.

## 8 Simple CSS3 transitions that will wow your users

1.What are some benefits to using CSS transitions on websites?

Color transition is easier to apply: now we can just set different colors transitions according to where you want them and what color you want them to be.
We can now utilize the grow property to change the size of an element without having to adjust through width, height and padding.
Changing element shapes is easier. Now you can give a div the class of "circle" and the CSS to your styles to change its' shape.

2.How this topic fit in with your long-term goals?

I really like the design and format of working in code. This is an area I'd like to excel in, as it's something that is easier to follow at first glance, but more importantly, playing on the webpages' visual appearance is fun, especially when you have an idea of how you want to see the webpage look. There are so many different properties to play with, and so many different ways to apply them, this information will go a long way in both saving time and space and will make those things easier on future long-term goals.
