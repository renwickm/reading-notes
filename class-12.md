### Chart.js Documentation

1.What is Chart.js and how it can be brought into your project?

Chart.js is a JavaScript format for implementing charts on your page, such as a bar chart. In order to do this you will need to link your script element as per usual, but a `<canvas>` node must also be used in order to render the chart to the page.

2.List 3 different Chart types you can creat using Chart.js.

### Easily Create Stunning Animated Charts with Chart.js

1.What are some advantages to displaying data via a chart over a table?

Charts are better at visual display of data points. The table is a great way to store data and run functions in an organized way. However, the visual read-out from a chart does a better job at drawing out the data into some that can be interpreted and provide additional meaning.

2.How could Chart.js aid your previously created applications visually?

You can easily apply charts to display the visual read-out of views, votes that apply to each submit result. This would provided an added feature to the page but, more importantly, give us a visual display of the significant data points given the suggested variables. If we were running tests and wanted to use the input we recieved from total submitted votes, we could utilize charts to tie with the total number of submits and that would give our overal test project a more complete presentation.
