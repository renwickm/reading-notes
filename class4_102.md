## Wireframing

>Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product (Allabarton, R., *The Definitive Guide: How to Make Your First Wireframe*, 2021).

### Examples

1.Invision
2.Balsamiq
3.UXPin
4.Wireframe.cc
5.By hand with paper/pen/pencil

>*style you choose to use depends largely on the how much emphasis there is on visual design in a project, and how much uncertainty there is with respect to what is being designed.

## HTML Basics

HTML (**H**yper**T**ext**M**arkup**L**anguage)

>Markup language that defines the **structure** of the content

HTML is like the bones and structure of your webpage. Communicate using HTML to format your webpage the way you'd like.

## Semantics

*Why are you running this code?*
