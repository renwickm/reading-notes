# My Reading Notes!

*This is where I'm going to put my reading assignments!*

**Growth mindset** is a concept derived from the combination of thought and motivation. Those seeking ***self-improvements**** re-direct their mindset in order to successfully promote their pre-determined goal. These goal/s, derived through thought, are charged through motivational factors such as personal, peer, cultural or societal influences. 

Reminders to stay in a growth mindset:
1. It's a marathon, not a sprint!
2. Goals are like walking. With each step, you move forward. So put your best foot forward!
3. There is nothing worth achieving that has ever been easy. So if you find the path your on to be most difficult, keep going! You're heading in the right direction.
