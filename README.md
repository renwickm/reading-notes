# Matt R's Reading Notes!

Hello, my name is Matthew Renwick and my pronouns are (he/him). I have an education background in psychology with a BS degree and have spent many years supporting myself through various trades in mechanics, transportation and customer service. However, I'm looking to make a change in career field with a focus in software developement. It is no suprise how far tech has come since the beginning of the century, but I expect it to continue growing and want to be a part of it. The decision to make a career change can be intimidating, but I'm more interested in going after the things you want and taking that chance because it might just be the best decision you've ever made! When I'm not studying or taking courses you can find me at the gym, running or cooking. Fitness is a big commitment and will eat up a lot of your time, so planning around it is most important! One of the greatest honors is to where the uniform, which I've been able to do part-time in the Army NG. The commitment to serve is a heavy one with great responsibility and I'm greatful for the opportunity! If you are interested in learning more Follow my link https://github.com/renwickm

**Growth mindset** is a concept derived from the combination of thought and motivation. Those seeking ***self-improvements**** re-direct their mindset in order to successfully promote their pre-determined goal. These goal/s, derived through thought, are charged through motivational factors such as personal, peer, cultural or societal influences. 

Reminders to stay in a growth mindset:
1. It's a marathon, not a sprint!
2. Goals are like walking. With each step, you move forward. So put your best foot forward!
3. There is nothing worth achieving that has ever been easy. So if you find the path your on to be most difficult, keep going! You're heading in the right direction.
