# Class 1 Reading Notes

## Markdown Dictionary

**Headings**
1. Apply the (#) sign before heading 
2. The number of (#) used determines the font size, or level, of heading specified
3. The largest font size begins at one (#), heading level 1
4. Adding more (#) decreases the font-size value with the lowest value at heading level 6

**Alternate syntax**
1. Heading level 1 can be issued by applying (=======) on the lines below the text
2. Simply, type your heading on one line. Press enter. Underline your heading with (=========)
3. This can also be accomplished for Heading level 2 using (-----------)

**Heading Best Practices**
1. Make sure to insert a space between (#) and your heading or it won't look right

**Paragraphs**
1. When coding your paragraphs, ensure you separate paragraphs with a blank line.

**Paragraph Best Practices**
1. Do NOT indent or put spaces in front of your paragraphs. 
2. There are reasons/ways of doing this, but most likely not neccessary. Indents are primarily used for other functions.
3. Keep your lines left-aligned.

**Line Break**
1. Create a line break or new line by ending that line with two or more spaces, then hit **return**.

**Line Break Best Practices**
1. It is hard to see empty spaces in markdown when presenting your line breaks (Trailing WhiteSpace).
2. Another opion is HTML, if your Markdown application supports it.
3. Simple insert <, followed by *br*, followed by > at the end of your line to insert the line break.
4. *BR* should be inside the left and right arrows

## Emphasis

**Bold**
1. Bolding text can be accomplished by adding two asterisks (**) or two underscores (__) before and after the text you want to emphasize.

**Bold Best Practices**
1. To emphasize the middle of a word or phrase, utilize the asterisk over the underscore and omit the white space.

**Italic**
1. Same practice as *bold* but instead of two asterisks or underscores, only use one.

***Bold and Italic***
1. To emphasize word or phrases with bold and italics, utilize three asterisks or underscores before and after a word or phrase.

**Blockquotes**
1. To insert a quote, or blockquote, in your text, insert a right arrow (>) before.
